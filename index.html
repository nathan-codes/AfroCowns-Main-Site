                      Angela began her loc journey when her late husband was
                      terminally ill. At the time it was more about convenience
                      as she had less and less time to deal with her hair but
                      also wanted a style that was healthy and beautiful. As a
                      locked sister, the journey has gone from a need for
                      convenience to being an authentic statement for her 3
                      daughters who also embrace the beautiful natural hair.
                      Embracing the varied styles that come with it, Angela is
                      content in sharing her loc journey in both her
                      professional and personal life and hope to see more women
                      of color embrace their natural and diverse beauty.
